        <h1 style="color: sandybrown;">About Me.</h1>
        <h2 style="color: dodgerblue;">Tech.</h2>
        <p style="color: white;"> Welcome to my website! My name is Soumyadip Chatterjee, and I’m an aspiring backend developer currently on a self-taught journey to mastering programming. I’m passionate about learning technologies that power the web and aim to build scalable, efficient backend systems.  

            My current learning path includes Node.js, SQL, and React, with foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m dedicated to building a strong understanding of backend development concepts and the tools that make modern web applications tick.  
            
            <h2 style="color: dodgerblue;">Interests.</h2>  
            <p style="color: white;">I follow a primal diet (advocated by Aajonus Vonderplantiz), which aligns with my focus on health and fitness. Bodybuilding is one of my favorite hobbies—it’s not just about strength but also discipline and growth. Philosophically, I’m inspired by thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Yukio Mishima, whose works resonate deeply with me.  
            
            Japan holds a special place in my heart as my long-term goal destination. I love researching its culture, history, and traditions, as well as its harmonious blend of modernity and nature. Speaking of nature, I dream of living close to it, surrounded by greenery, where I can enjoy a peaceful and sustainable lifestyle.  
            
            I’m also learning Japanese, diving into its beautiful language to better understand and connect with the culture I admire so much.
